<h1 align="center">Hi there, I'm Zi-ang Cao âœ¨</h1>

![visitors](https://visitor-badge.laobi.icu/badge?page_id=Zi-ang-Cao.Zi-ang-Cao)

I am a second-year MS student in the Robotics track at Stanford University. Over the past year, I've been working with Jingyun Yang and Prof. Jeannette Bohg on equivariant imitation learning for mobile manipulation. Before joining Stanford, I completed my B.Eng. degree at the University of Pittsburgh in 2023.

## ðŸŒ± Research Interests
In the coming year, I am eager to delve deeper into robotic learning and cross-embodiment learning. I am actively seeking research opportunities in these areas. If you're interested in collaborating or learning more about my work, feel free to reach out to me at `ziangcao@stanford.edu`.

## ðŸŽ“ Future Plans
I plan to graduate from Stanford University in June 2025 and am actively looking for PhD opportunities in Robotic Learning for Fall 2025.
